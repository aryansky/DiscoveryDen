Hey everyone,
DiscoveryDen is a basic Full stack project that I have designed while learning the basics of web development.

The main idea was to build a website that shows the popular destination (tourist spots) and displays each of them in detail. Users can login and create new spots as well as reveiw other spots.

The technologies that I have used are HTML, CSS, JS, EJS, MongoDB, mongoose, Node.js, Express and more.
I have used Maptiler for the implementation of maps and geo coding.

After building this project I think I have got a good start in web dev journey, It has really helped me clear many of my concepts by implementing them into this project.

The project still has many issues but I think I will leave them be and move on to more advanced projects from now on!
